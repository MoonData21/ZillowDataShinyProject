# ZillowDataShinyProject
This project was taken from the Alex the Analyst Shiny Youtube Project Video. Shiny and Python were the libraries used for this project. Additional functionality was added such as Median List Price per City by month and % of housing inventory month over month. Please go to the Master Branch to see the code.
